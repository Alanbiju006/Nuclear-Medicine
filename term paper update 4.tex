\section*{Abstract}

gold nanoparticles have gained increased interest as radiosensitizing, photothermal therapy and optical imaging agents to enhance the effectiveness of cancer detection and therapy.in this paper we will be focusing about nuclear medicine in general and how gold nanoparticles will be useful. unique optical and physicochemical properties, gold nanoparticles have gained increased interestas in radiosensitizing, photothermal therapy, and optical imaging agents to enhance the effectiveness of cancer detection and therapy. Furthermore, their ability to carry multiple medically relevant radionuclides broadens their use to nuclear medicine SPECT and PET imaging as well as targeted radionuclide therapy. In this review, we discuss the radiolabeling process of gold nanoparticles and their use in (multimodal) nuclear medicine imaging to better understand their specific distribution, uptake, and retention in different in vivo cancer models. In addition,
radiolabeled gold nanoparticles enable image-guided therapy is reviewed as well as the enhancement of targetedradionuclide therapy and nanobrachytherapy through an increased dose deposition and radiosensitization, asdemonstrated by multiple Monte Carlo studies and experimental in vitro and in vivo studies.
